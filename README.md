# Tribute-Page

I created a tribute page for an unit from a game called Project SEKAI: Colorful Stage! (Official translation: HATSUNE MIKU: COLORFUL STAGE!). The unit is Nightcord at 25:00. I used Figma to design and protype the website. Then plan to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code the website. Everything besides the the website design and the code belongs to SEGA, Colorful Palette, and Crypton Future Media. I own nothing besides the website design and the code for the website.
